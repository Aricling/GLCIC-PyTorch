## Dependencies

## DEMO (Inference)

### 1. Download our pretrained model and the training config file.

Pretrained model: [download](https://home.com)  
Training config file: [download](https://hoge.com)  

The pretrained model was trained with CelebA dataset.  
The hyper parameters and the model architecture is exactly the same
as what described in the paper.

Training config file saves training settings in json format.  
This file is required to make models predict in the same environment as training time.
