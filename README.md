## About this repository

Here, we provide a high-quality pytorch implementation of [GLCIC](http://hi.cs.waseda.ac.jp/~iizuka/projects/completion/data/completion_sig2017.pdf) introduced by Iizuka et. al.

## Dependencies

## DEMO (Inference)

### 1. Download our pretrained model and the training config file.

Pretrained model: [download](https://home.com)  
Training config file: [download](https://hoge.com)  

The pretrained model was trained with CelebA dataset.
The hyper parameters and the model architecture is exactly the same
as what described in the paper.

The training config file saves the training settings in json format, and
this file is required to make the model predict in the same environment as training time.

### 2. Inference on a image
